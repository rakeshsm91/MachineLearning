Additionally, you must make at least one submission to the **Kaggle** competition before it closes at **4:59pm on Friday February 23rd**. Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Moodle. Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. Your solutions to analysis questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.

    "When people are discussing popular media, there’s a concept of spoilers. That is, critical information about the plot of a TV show, book, or movie that “ruins” the experience for people who haven’t read / seen it yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to do text classification on forum posts from the website [tvtropes.org](http://tvtropes.org/), to predict whether a post is a spoiler or not. We'll be using the logistic regression classifier provided by sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike previous assignments, the code provided with this assignment has all of the functionality required. Your job is to make the functionality better by improving the features the code uses for text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Because the goal of this assignment is feature engineering, not classification algorithms, you may not change the underlying algorithm or it's parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is structured in a way that approximates how classification works in the real world: Features are typically underspecified (or not specified at all). You, the data digger, have to articulate the features you need. You then compete against others to provide useful predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem straightforward, but do not start this at the last minute. There are often many things that go wrong in testing out features, and you'll want to make sure your features work well once you've found them.\n"

It should have the example Id as the first column and the prediction (`True` or `False`) as the second column. If you change this format your submissions will be scored as zero accuracy on Kaggle. \n",

    "### POS(Part of Speech) Tagging:\n",
    "I used the POS feature because when I went through the training data, I was able to see more verbs which came after nouns, which indicates, if a person is saying something about spoiler he has to refer a person or the character followed by an action that took place in the movie/event. So I guessed, having bi-gram features of the POS tags of words was an interesting feature.\n",
    "After some error analyis, I saw that there were non-spoiler statements which had similar bi-gram POS tagging features as well. \n",
    "Hence, I used the bag-of-words of the verbs occuring i.e the more the verbs, the more probabilty of predicting it as a spoiler. But it did not completely boost the accuracy as many of the non-spoilers had a slightly lesser verbs. For example,  one of the misclassified example was:\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are more than 8 verbs, and there are nouns occuring before verb, yet is considered as non-spoiler.\n",
    "After careful analyis, I think we have to appropriately stem the sentences and consider the verb of the third person which can be extracted by NLTK tags. This might increase our accuracy, which I havent tried in this assignment.\n",
    "Through this feature, I was able to improve the accuracy only by 0.5%.\n"

    "Special Characters is something which was quite tough to explore. I observed that the spoilers had more number of special characters, especially double quotes and brackets. Digging into the data, I found that, the instances such as places, names were being sorrounded by double quotes, which are ususally used when trying to refer something, making it more probaable towards spoiler.\n",

    "Length of a sentence is one of the feature that I explored analysing the train data. I performed a thoruough analysis on how the length of postive and the negative spoilers were. Unfortunately there was not much of a big difference as you can see in the below code where only around an additional of 800 positive samples were having a higher average length than the negative samples. Because of this, there was not a big improvement in the accuracy,  and it resulted in a improvement of 1%"

    "> Can I heavily modify the FeatEngr class? \n",
    "\n",
    "Totally.  This was just a starting point.  The only thing you cannot modify is the LogisticRegression classifier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Can I look at TV Tropes?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gain insight about the data yes, however, your feature extraction cannot use any additional data (beyond what I've given you) from the TV Tropes webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can I use IMDB, Wikipedia, or a dictionary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, but you are not required to. So long as your features are fully automated, they can use any dataset other than TV Tropes. Be careful, however, that your dataset does not somehow include TV Tropes (e.g. using all webpages indexed by Google will likely include TV Tropes).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can I combine features?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, and you probably should. This will likely be quite effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can I use Mechanical Turk?\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not fully automatic, so no. You should be able to run your feature extraction without any human intervention. If you want to collect data from Mechanical Turk to train a classifier that you can then use to generate your features, that is fine. (But that’s way too much work for this assignment.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can I use a Neural Network to automatically generate derived features? \n",
    "\n",
    "No. This assignment is about your ability to extract meaningful features from the data using your own experimentation and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What sort of improvement is “good” or “enough”?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have 10-15% improvement over the baseline (on the Public Leaderboard) with your features, that’s more than sufficient. If you fail to get that improvement but have tried reasonable features, that satisfies the requirements of assignment. However, the extra credit for “winning” the class competition depends on the performance of other students.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Where do I start?  \n",
    "\n",
    "It might be a good idea to look at the in-class notebook associated with the Feature Engineering lecture where we did similar experiments. \n",

    "> Why does it say that the competition ends at 11:59pm when the assignment says 4:59pm? \n",
    "\n",
    "The end time/date are in UTC.  11:59pm UTC is equivalent to 4:59pm MST.  Kaggle In-Class does not allow us to change this. "
